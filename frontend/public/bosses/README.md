# Boss Images Folder

Drop boss images here and they will automatically appear on the website.

## Naming Convention

Images should be named using the format: `{boss_name}_{difficulty}.png` or `{boss_name}_{difficulty}.jpg`

Examples:
- `zakum_normal.png`
- `hilla_hard.png`
- `lucid_normal.png`
- `seren_normal.png`

If a boss has no difficulty (or you want a default image), use: `{boss_name}.png`

Examples:
- `zakum.png` (will be used for all Zakum difficulties if no specific difficulty image exists)

## Supported Formats
- PNG (.png)
- JPG/JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- WebP (.webp)

## Fallback Behavior

If no image is found for a boss, a placeholder will be shown that doesn't break functionality.
